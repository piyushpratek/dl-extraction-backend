High-Level System Design

1. Components of the System:
   User Interface (UI): A front-end React application where users can upload documents.
   Document Processing Module: This module is responsible for processing the uploaded documents. It includes:
   Optical Character Recognition (OCR): To extract text from the uploaded documents.
   Data Extraction Logic: To parse the extracted text and identify key details (name, document number, issue and expiration dates).
   Data Storage: A database to store the extracted data securely MongoDB.
   Validation Module: This module verifies the accuracy of the extracted data (e.g., checking formats for dates or document numbers).

2. Data Flow:
   Users upload a document through the UI.
   The document is sent to the Document Processing Module.
   OCR processes the document with help of sharp and extracts text.
   The Data Extraction Logic parses the text to extract key details.
   Extracted data is validated and stored in the database.
   Users can view their submitted documents and extracted information in the UI.
